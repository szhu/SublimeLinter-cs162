SublimeLinter-clang
-------------------------------
This linter plugin for SublimeLinter provides an interface to any C compiler
output served at http://192.168.162.162:16280.

It is intended to be used with the Pintos VM from UC Berkeley's CS 162 course,
so that you can see compile-time errors without needing to run make manually.


** IMPORTANT! **

Before this plugin will activate, you *must*
follow the installation instructions here:
